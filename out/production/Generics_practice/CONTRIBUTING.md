# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project on **Java Generics**!
This repository focuses on practical and theoretical examples of Java generics, primarily inspired by *Herbert Schildtâ€™s* work, but contributions beyond that scope are welcome.

---

## Scope of the Project

This repository is intended to:

* Demonstrate key concepts of Java Generics (bounded types, wildcards, type inference, generic methods, etc.)
* Provide clean, understandable examples aligned with best practices
* Extend into related topics such as collections, functional interfaces, and generic algorithms

---

## How to Contribute

### 1. Fork & Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/java-generics-examples.git
```

### 2. Create a Feature Branch

Name your branch based on the feature or topic:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/add-generic-method-example
```

### 3. Make Changes

* Follow Java coding standards (`camelCase`, clear class naming, etc.)
* Keep your code readable and well-commented if needed
* Organize your code in appropriate packages (e.g., `generic.methods`, `wildcards.unbounded`, etc.)
* Include a short explanation of your example as a JavaDoc or inline comment

### 4. Add Tests (if applicable)

If your contribution includes logic that can be tested, please add unit tests using **JUnit 5**.

### 5. Commit Convention

Use clear, concise commit messages. Example:

```bash
git commit -m "Add example for generic method with bounded type"
```

### 6. Push and Create a Pull Request

```bash
git push origin feature/add-generic-method-example
```

Then open a pull request describing:

* What youâ€™ve added or changed
* Why itâ€™s useful or important
* Any reference to a chapter or topic (if relevant)

## Need Ideas?

If you're looking to contribute but don't know what to work on, check out the [open issues](https://github.com/YOUR_REPO/issues) or consider adding examples for:

* **Wildcard usage** (bounded, unbounded, and capture)
* **Generic interfaces**
* **Type erasure demonstration**
* **Raw types and legacy compatibility**
* **Generic class hierarchies**
* **Practical use cases in Collections API**
